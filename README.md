👋 Hey there, I’m Elad

I’m a Computer Science student at Ariel University 🇮🇱 and a software developer specializing in systems programming, network protocols & security, and deep learning for computer vision.
I enjoy building high-performance, well-architected software - from network servers to vision systems - with an emphasis on practical impact.

🧰 Tech Stack & Skills
💻 Languages

C++17 (advanced) • Python (advanced) • C (networking) • SQL • Bash • Java

⚙️ Core Expertise

Systems Programming - multithreading, concurrency, socket programming, performance tuning

🚀 Featured Projects

🧠 HTTP/3 Analysis and Attack (final project - research)
Final-year project focused on the internals and security of HTTP/3 (QUIC). Developed a state-of-the-art Spoofed-ACK attack against the ACK mechanism in QUIC - including traffic capture, key-log based decryption for analysis, and automated attack scripts that target the ACK/reliability logic. Results include a proof-of-concept implementation and a set of mitigations and recommendations.

🧠 Optical-Drone-Navigation (in progress)
A real-time image matching system for drone navigation. The drone compares live camera input to stored reference images along its flight path to enable optical navigation without GPS. Currently implementing ORB feature extraction and matching using OpenCV, with PyTorch planned for future learning-based improvements.

🕹 C++ Catan Games
Board games implemented with SFML, featuring turn-based game logic, player state management, and interactive board visualization.

⚡ Thread Pool TCP Server
High-performance multithreaded TCP server implementing the Reactor and Leader-Follower patterns. Designed to efficiently accept and handle many concurrent clients while minimizing latency.

🧪 Algorithmic & Network Utilities
Custom graph utilities (MST, shortest path), packet-sniffing and analysis tools, dynamic programming templates, and network testing scripts.
