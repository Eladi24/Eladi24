# 👋 Hi, I’m Elad

I’m a **Computer Science student** at Ariel University 🇮🇱 and a software developer specializing in **systems programming**, **network protocols & security**, and **deep learning for computer vision**.  
I enjoy building high-performance, well-architected software - from network servers to vision systems - with an emphasis on practical impact.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧠 HTTP/3 Analysis and Attack *(Final Project — Research)*
Final-year project focused on the internals and security of HTTP/3 (QUIC).  
Developed a state-of-the-art **Spoofed-ACK attack** against the ACK mechanism in QUIC — including:
- Traffic capture and key-log based decryption for analysis  
- Automated attack scripts targeting ACK and reliability logic  
- Proof-of-concept implementation, mitigations, and recommendations

---

### 🧠 Optical-Drone-Navigation *(In Progress)*
A real-time **image matching system** for drone navigation.  
The drone compares live camera input to stored reference images along its flight path to enable optical navigation without GPS.  
Currently implementing **ORB feature extraction** and matching with OpenCV, with PyTorch planned for future learning-based enhancements.

### 🕹 C++ Catan Game
Board game implemented with SFML, featuring:
- Turn-based game logic
- Player state management
- Interactive board visualization
