# 👋 Hi, I'm Elad ✨

I'm a **B.Sc. Computer Science student** at Ariel University  
Passionate about **systems programming**, **network protocols & security**, and **deep learning in computer vision**.  
I love building robust and scalable software projects that solve real-world problems.

## About Me
- Experienced in **C++**, **Python**, and low-level systems development.  
- Worked on **network protocol research** (HTTP/3 QUIC Spoofed-ACK attack).  
- Currently developing **real-time vision-based navigation systems** for drones.  
- Always curious to learn, build, and improve.
