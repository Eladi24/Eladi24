# 👋 Hi, I'm Elad Imany

I'm a **B.Sc. Computer Science student** at Ariel University, passionate about **systems programming**, **network protocols & security**, and **deep learning in computer vision**.  
I enjoy designing and implementing robust, scalable systems that blend performance, precision, and creativity.

## About Me
I’m an aspiring software engineer with a strong interest in **low-level programming**, **network research**, and **intelligent systems**.  
My work focuses on building high-performance C++ and Python applications, from network servers to AI-based vision projects.  
I’m naturally curious, enjoy solving complex problems, and believe that great engineering comes from understanding both theory and practice.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### HTTP/3 Analysis and Attack — *Final Project (Research)*
A comprehensive research and implementation project focused on analyzing vulnerabilities in the HTTP/3 protocol.  
As part of the work, I developed a **novel Spoofed-ACK attack** that targets the ACK mechanism in QUIC, demonstrating how reliability and congestion control can be manipulated under certain conditions.  
The project included packet-level interception, key-log decryption, traffic replay, and proof-of-concept validation, along with a proposed set of mitigation techniques.  
This project combined deep networking knowledge, systems-level C++ and Python coding, and a strong focus on real-world security research.

### Optical Drone Navigation — *In Progress*
A real-time **image matching system** for drone navigation that enables autonomous movement without GPS.  
The drone continuously compares its live camera feed to preloaded reference images along the flight path using **ORB feature extraction** in OpenCV, with PyTorch planned for learning-based improvements.  
This project explores the intersection of computer vision, embedded systems, and robotics.

### Catan — *C++ / SFML*
A full-featured GUI board game based on *The Settlers of Catan*, developed using C++ and SFML.  
Implements turn-based mechanics, resource management, and an interactive map interface, focusing on clean object-oriented design and reusable components.

### Thread Pool TCP Server
A multithreaded TCP server architecture combining the **Reactor** and **Leader-Follower** patterns.  
Built for efficient concurrent client handling, with focus on synchronization, thread promotion, and low-latency I/O.  
The project demonstrates a deep understanding of concurrency control and event-driven software design.

## Beyond Code
Outside of software, I enjoy playing guitar, cooking, and exploring creative side projects.  
I believe in continuous learning and building things that bring ideas to life — whether in tech, music, or everyday creativity.
